      <p> TaskSync started out as a software project for our Senior Capstone Class (at one point we wanted to call it Agenda Ninja, but that was scrapped for respectibility's sake).
        [Editor's Note: I still wanted it though]

      </p>
      <p> Anyway, we hope your team can get some use out of this project. 
      </p>
