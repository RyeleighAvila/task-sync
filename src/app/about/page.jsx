      <p> TaskSync started out as a software project for our Senior Capstone Class (at one point we wanted to call it Agenda Ninja, but that was scrapped for respectibility's sake).
        [Editor's Note: I still wanted it though]
        Anyway, we hope your team can get some use out of this project. 
        Sincerely,
        Khoi Le

        p.s. Thank you to our instructor, Asaad Althoubi, for helping us out along the way.
